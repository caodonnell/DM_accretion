This repository will (eventually) contain files and scripts related to my research into correlating dark matter accretion and galaxy star formation (O'Donnell et al., submitted).

Currently, this repo houses the isolated host (and associated random) files used in the analysis:
* **SDSS/**: data files derived from SDSS DR16
  * **!notes**:
  * **isolated_hosts_10.5_11.0.txt**: catalog of isolated hosts in the stellar mass range $10.5 < \log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot) < 11.0$
  * **isolated_hosts_10.5_11.0.txt**: catalog of isolated hosts in the stellar mass range ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10.5%20%3C%20%5Clog_%7B10%7D%28M_*/M_%5Codot%29%20%3C%2011.0)
  * **isolated_hosts_11.0_11.5.txt**: catalog of isolated hosts in the stellar mass range ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?11.0%20%3C%20%5Clog_%7B10%7D%28M_*/M_%5Codot%29%20%3C%2011.5)

* **UniverseMachine/**: data files dervied from the ^^UniverseMachine^^
