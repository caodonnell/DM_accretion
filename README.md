This repository will (eventually) contain files and scripts related to my research into correlating dark matter accretion and galaxy star formation (O'Donnell et al., submitted).

Currently, this repo houses the isolated host (and associated random) files used in the analysis:
* SDSS/
  * *!notes*: 
  * *isolated_hosts_10.5_11.0.txt*: catalog of isolated hosts in the stellar mass range ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10.5%20%3C%20%5Clog_%7B10%7D%28M_*/M_%5Codot%29%20%3C%2011.0)
  * *isolated_randoms_10.5_11.0.txt*: list of random pointings used in the anlsysis (100 per isolated host in the mass range ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10.5%20%3C%20%5Clog_%7B10%7D%28M_*/M_%5Codot%29%20%3C%2011.0))
