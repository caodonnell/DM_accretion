The files in this director are organized by simulation snapshot (in terms of their scale factors $a$) in the UniverseMachine (Behroozi et al. 2019) using Bolshoi-Planck data for the halo properties (Klypin et al. 2016; Rodríguez-Puebla et al. 2016b).

All of the host catalogs have the following columns: 0. UniverseMachine ID: large IDs (>10^11) indicate that the halo is an orphan

UPID: ID of parent halo (-1 if it is not a subhalo)
     0.  X: position (Mpc/h)
1.  Y: position (Mpc/h)
2.  Z: position (Mpc/h), used as line of sight in the analysis in O'Donnell et al., submitted
3.  VX: velocity along x-axis (km/s)
4.  VY: velocity along y-axis (km/s)
5.  VZ: velocity along z-axis (km/s)
6.  DX_eff: effective velocity distance along x-axis for redshift calculations
7.  DY_eff: effective velocity distance along y-axis for redshift calculations
8.  DZ_eff: effective velocity distance along z-axis for redshift calculations
9.  Rank1: rank variable related to halo accretion (from the UniverseMachine)
10.  obs_SM: log10(stellar mass, in solar mass units), factoring in true stellar mass and observational biases
12.  obs_SFR: log10(star formation rate, in solar masses per year), factoring in true SFR and observational biases
13.  SSFR: log10(specific star formation rate, in solar masses per year), facotring in the true SSFR and observational biases
14.  Accret: halo accretion rates, in solar masses per 10^9 years

For each catalog, the filename indicates the minimum and maximum observed stellar mass (log10, in solar mass units) of the isolated hosts included

As described in O'Donnell et al. (2021), the mass function of the UniverseMachine differs from the mass function in SDSS (Sec. 3.3.1, including Fig. 10 and Table 1). In our work (and the filenames in this repo), we use SDSS mass values. Thus, some obs_SM values in these catalogs may appear to fall outside of the indicated mass ranges, but that is an effect of the choice of the stellar mass definition
