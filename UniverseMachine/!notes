The files in this director are organized by simulation snapshot (in terms of their scale factors $a$) in the UniverseMachine (Behroozi et al. 2019) using Bolshoi-Planck data for the halo properties (Klypin et al. 2016; Rodríguez-Puebla et al. 2016b).

All of the host catalogs have the following columns:
0. UniverseMachine ID: large IDs (>10^11) indicate that the halo is an orphan
1. UPID: ID of parent halo (-1 if it is not a subhalo)
2. X: position (Mpc/h)
3. Y: position (Mpc/h)
4. Z: position (Mpc/h), used as line of sight in the analysis in O'Donnell et al., submitted
5. VX: velocity along x-axis (km/s)
6. VY: velocity along y-axis (km/s)
7. VZ: velocity along z-axis (km/s)
8. DX_eff: effective velocity distance along x-axis for redshift calculations
9. DY_eff: effective velocity distance along y-axis for redshift calculations
10. DZ_eff: effective velocity distance along z-axis for redshift calculations
11. Rank1: rank variable related to halo accretion (from the UniverseMachine)
12. obs_SM: log10(stellar mass, in solar mass units), factoring in true stellar mass and observational biases
13. obs_SFR: log10(star formation rate, in solar masses per year), factoring in true SFR and observational biases
14. SSFR: log10(specific star formation rate, in solar masses per year), facotring in the true SSFR and observational biases
15. Accret: halo accretion rates, in solar masses per 10^9 years
