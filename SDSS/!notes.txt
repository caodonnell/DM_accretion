All of the files in this folder have the following columns:
0. RA (degrees)
1. dec (degrees)
2. z (redshift)
3. BPT class
4. SM: log10(stellar mass, in solar units)
5. Dn(4000) index
6. SPECSFR: log10(specific star formation rate, yr^-1)
7. volume weight

Columns 0-6 are derived from SDSS DR16 data (Ahumada et al. 2019). The final column is a source weight to account for the stellar mass completeness (Eqs. 2 and 7 in O'Donnell et al., 2021).
